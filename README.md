# Pet-Projects
This repository is a collection of proprietary data science &amp; machine learning projects made exclusively by me. These projects can range from trading algorithms to scatter plots using Seaborn or predicting data using machine learning algorithms. File names denoted with a double/triple asterisk are projects I am particularly proud of.
